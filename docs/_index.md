## Tyrian

Tyrian is an Elm-inspired, purely functional UI library for Scala 3.

Its purpose is to make building interactive websites in Scala 3 fun! Tyrian allows you to describe web pages and complex interactions in a way that is elegant, easy to read and easy to reason about.

Tyrian is not designed to work alone, the intention is that you will use it alongside a web bundler to look after things like your media assets and stylesheets. (All our examples use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).)

### Tyrian 💜's Indigo

> Coming in the next release!!

Tyrian is by the maintainers of [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io/), a Scala 3 game engine. As such, Indigo web games are first class citizens in Tyrian, allowing easy embedding and seamless communication between their respective event/messaging systems.

### What should I consider using Tyrian for?

Tyrian is designed for building SPAs (Single Page Applications). Web pages with lots of interactive elements.

One use case we're particularly excited about is augmenting Indigo games with rich HTML UI elements.

> SSR (Server-side Rendering) is on the road map!

### What should I avoid using Tyrian for?

Tyrian is not a great candidate for static websites - like this one! - where the content is there to be read, not interacted / played / engaged with.
