/** An HtmlFragment represents a chunk of Html that will potentially make up part of the final DOM output. Though it
  * aids 'out-of-order' dom tree construction, it is not the same as a template (which in Tyrian Next is any function of
  * some data to Elem[GlobalMsg]). Instead it is either a) markup to be appended, and / or b) markup to inserted.
  *
  * The normal form of an HtmlFragment is as a number of chunks of markup, that will ultimately be appended to some
  * parent div, typically a div. This is the top level structure of your page.
  *
  * HtmlFragments can be combined using the `combine` method (or `|+|` operator, which is an alias for combine).
  *
  * If you'd like, in some separate process, to be able to render something that goes into that top level structure,
  * than you can add a placeholder tag to your top level markup called a `Marker`. When you render the html to be
  * associated with the marker, you add it to an HtmlFragment fragment using the `insert` method (or constructor) and
  * give it the same ID as your placeholder Marker tag.
  *
  * Markers have an ID, and can also include child elements. When your HtmlFragments are resolved by the `HtmlRoot` it
  * attempts to replace markers with an insert that has the same id.
