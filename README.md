# Tyrian

An Elm-inspired Scala UI library for Scala 3.

The main documentation site, complete with installation instructions, is available here:
[tyrian.indigoengine.io/](https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/)

## Local build instructions

Tyrian is fairly straight forward to build locally, run the following commands from your terminal in the project root:

```sh
npm install
sbt clean update compile test +publishLocal
```

There is also a `build.sh` script in the root folder, but that also builds the docs and example projects (based on the currently released version).
